# wine-classification
This project, completed as part of the CODTECH internship, involves the implementation and evaluation of a machine learning model for a classification task. The objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify different types of wine based on their chemical properties.
Task Details
The goal of this task is to demonstrate proficiency in:

Data Loading and Preparation: Handling a dataset and splitting it for training and testing.

Model Building: Implementing a machine learning classifier using scikit-learn.

Model Training and Prediction: Fitting the model to the training data and making predictions on unseen test data.

Performance Evaluation: Using appropriate metrics to assess the model's accuracy and performance.

Dataset
The project utilizes the Wine Recognition Dataset, which is a classic, built-in dataset in the scikit-learn library. It contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.
